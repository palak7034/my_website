---

I was born and brought up in India, recently moved to UK for my Pursuing Masters in Analytics and Management from London Business School. I have keen interest in the field of Data and Analytics, Astronomy and Quantum Mechanics.
I want to work in the field of analytics in future. 

In free time, I like listening to music. Always happy to receive new music recommendations :)
